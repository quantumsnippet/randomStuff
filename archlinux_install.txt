ARCHLINUX INSTALL PROCEDURE

1) Verify the boot mode

    # ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars

    If you get a bunch of lines, all is well.

2)  Connect to the internet

    # ping -c 5 archlinux.org

    It will only ping 5 times

3) Update the system clock

    # timedatectl set-ntp true  

    We tell our computer to sync the date and time. At this point we do NOT say what timezone we are in.

4) Partition the disks
    
    # lsblk 

    Check BEFORE PARTITION correctly.

    # cfdisk

    Here you do the necessary partitioning.

    swap partition - 2G - sda8 - Linux swap
    /boot partition - 512M - sda9 - EFI System
    / partition - Rest of the system - sda10 - Linux filesystem

    Do the partitioning and write it. Check your partitioning again using #lsblk.

5) Format the partitions

    Format the EFI partition.
    # mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda9

    Format the swap partition and activate it.
    # mkswap /dev/sda8
    # swapon /dev/sda8

    Format the root partition
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda10

6) Mount the File Systems

    We need to mount our created partitions into our linux hierarchy. First we need to mount the root partition into /mnt. Then we create /mnt/boot in which we mount the boot partition.
    # mount /dev/sda10 /mnt
    # mkdir /mnt/boot
    # mount /dev/sda9 /mnt/boot

7) Install essential packages (using pacstrap)

    # pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux-lts linux-lts-headers linux-firmware nano vim bash-completion

8) FSTAB

    We generate a fstab (File System Table) file so linux will know what partitions we have like swap, boot and root.
    
    # genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
    
    You should have the partitions as you have configured when you open the file with 
    # vim /mnt/etc/fstab
    
9) CHROOT

    Moving inside the future linux system and changing elements there.
    # arch-chroot /mnt
    
10) Time Zone

    # ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime
    
    # hwclock --systohc
    
11) Localization

    vim /etc/locale.gen
    
    Uncomment the language en_IN UTF-8 and save it. Generate the locale.
    # locale-gen
    
    Also set the variable LANG or language to reflect the same choice.
    # echo LANG=en_IN.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf

12) Hostname

    echo MyHostname > /etc/hostname
    
    # vim /etc/hosts
    
    Type the following in the file and save it.
    
    127.0.0.1   localhost
    ::1         localhost
    127.0.1.1   MyHostname.localdomain MyHostname
    
13) Network Configuration

    # pacman -S networkmanager
    # systemctl enable NetworkManager
    
    NetworkManager is case sensitive. You will get 3 symlink lines as a result.
    
14) Root Password

    # passwd
    
15) Bootloader

    # pacman -S grub efibootmgr os-prober ntfs-3g
    # grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot
    # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
 
16) Unmount disks and Reboot

    Exit the chroot and unmount all disks and reboot.
    
    # exit   
    $ umount -a
    $ reboot
    
    Login to the new system with the root account. Username:root and Password: whatever you specified
    
17) Adding User
    
    Create 'darshan' user with sudo access.
    # useradd darshan
    # passwd darshan
        
    Type the password here. Then you have to run visudo as root to edit the sudoers file
    
    # visudo
    
    Uncomment the wheel group. It is the line which begins with wheel and save it.
    
    %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       ALL
    
    Add 'darshan' to the wheel group user usermod command.
    
    # usermod -aG wheel darshan

    Okay so now test whether you really have sudo power. 
    17.1) Use the su to switch to the new user account that you created.
            # su darshan
            
    17.2) Use the groups to verify that the user is in the wheel group.
            $ groups
            darshan wheel
            
    17.3) Use the sudo command to run the whoami command.
            $ sudo whoami
            root
            
18) Include the 'multilib' repository

    $ vim /etc/pacman.conf
    
    Uncomment the repository line and save it.
    
    [multilib]
    include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
    
19) Update the system and reboot once.
    
20) X Server, Desktop Environment(DE), Display Manager(DM)
    
    Before installing a DE, you will need to install the X Server first. Once it is completed, install DE.
    $ sudo pacman -S xorg
    $ sudo pacman -S mate mate-extra
    
    You will also need a display manager to log in to your desktop environment. For the ease, you can install LXDM.
    $ sudo pacman -S lxdm
    
    Once installed, you can enable to start each time you reboot your system.
    $ sudo systemctl enable lxdm.service
    
    Reboot your system and you will see the LXDM login screen, select your desktop environment from the list and login.
            
21) Getting Wi-Fi connection

    Broadcom BCM 43142 requires broadcom-wl-dkms package.
    $ sudo pacman -S broadcom-wl-dkms
       
    To load the new module, run the following commands as root:
    # rmmod b43 b43legacy bcm43xx bcma brcm80211 brcmfmac brcmsmac ssb wl
    # modprobe wl
    
    Also, install Network Manager Applet to get the Wifi icon applet.
    $ sudo pacman -S network-manager-applet
    
    And reboot the system to get Wi-Fi.
    
22) Install AUR helper yay

23) Install pamac-aur, google-chrome, downgrade, mate-tweak, vim-youcompleteme-git and other packages you want from AUR and the repositories.

    INSTALLING THESE PACKAGES IS A MUST.
        pacman-contrib
        network-manager-applet
        p7zip
        unrar
        gvfs
        gvfs-mtp (For Android File Transfer)

        bleachbit
        ranger  
        git
        curl
        wget
        gvim (for +clipboard support for copy pasting between system clipboard and vim buffers)
        vim-airline
        vim-airline-themes
        vim-nerdtree	
        vim-syntastic
        vim-nerdcommenter

        xfce4-terminal
        gufw

24) Get the Sound working
        
    $ sudo pacman -S pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa pavucontrol alsa-utils alsa-plugins alsa-lib alsa-firmware gstreamer volumeicon
    
    $ alsamixer
    
    Press M and unmute the channels and keep increasing the volume levels on all channels to your likings. Check the sound systems.
    
25) Install tlp 
    $ sudo pacman -S tlp
    
    $ sudo tlp-stat
    
    Do the necessary implementations and generate the symlinks and enable the services.
    
26) Install intel-ucode

    $ sudo pacman -S intel-ucode

    Regenerate the grub.cfg.
    $ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
        
27) Use all cores for compiling. 
	
	Go to /etc/makepkg.conf file.
	
	Search for "MAKEFLAGS". Replace the "-j2" with "-j$(nproc)". 
	This uses all cores when compiling now.

28) Configure the keyboard shortcuts in the DE and change the DE settings.

29) Pacman hooks to clean package cache and to deal with .pacnew files

        $ sudo mkdir /etc/pacman.d/hooks

        Create a file /etc/pacman.d/hooks/clean_package_cache.hook

        $ sudo vim /etc/pacman.d/hooks/clean_package_cache.hook
        
        Add the following lines:
        
                        [Trigger]
                        Operation = Upgrade
                        Operation = Install
                        Operation = Remove
                        Type = Package
                        Target = *
                        [Action]
                        Description = CLEANING PACMAN CACHE...
                        When = PostTransaction
                        Exec = /usr/bin/paccache -r

        Now, create a hook to deal with .pacnew files as well.

        $ sudo vim /etc/pacman.d/hooks/pacdiff.hook
        
        Add the following lines:

                        [Trigger]
                        Operation = Install
                        Operation = Upgrade
                        Operation = Remove
                        Type = Package
                        Target = *
                        [Action]
                        Description = CHECKING FOR PACNEW FILES...
                        When = PostTransaction
                        Exec = /usr/bin/pacdiff

30) Journal Size Limit

        The maximum size of the persistent journal can be controlled by uncommenting and changing the following:
                
                # vim /etc/systemd/journald.conf

                SystemMaxUse=100M

        Restart the systemd-journald.service after changing this setting to apply the new limit. 
        # systemctl restart systemd-journald.service

31) Setup Firewall using gufw
	
      $ sudo enable ufw
	
      To make sure that the firewall starts every time you reboot the computer
      $ sudo systemctl enable ufw
        
32) Update and reboot.
